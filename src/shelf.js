// The way I read this is that in order to pass the test, you need to 'feed' the function the book title as an argument.
// The trick to this one is that there's no 'good way' to then access the higher level book object from within the array.
// The answer is to use an arrow function which can run another function within the function to specifically look at the objects within the array.

function listTitles(shelf) {
  var titlesArr = [];
  var titles = "";
  for (i = 0; i < shelf.length; i++) {
    titlesArr.push(shelf[i].title);
  }
  titles = titlesArr.join(", ");
  console.log(titles);
  return titles;
}

// The best way I can think of to solve the 'join' problem, which is that you need the titles of the objects all in a string, but you can't have a comma on the last index (ergo you can't just do string interpolation easily) is to put all the titles in their own array and then join them.
